# To do

*MDDM: Mcdiarmid Drift Detection Method*

- [x] implement a drift detector that doesn't immediately need the class
    - MDDM does not work because it requires knowledge of class to insert it into the sliding window (similar to FHDDM(S))
- [x] allow online and chunk based learning (sklearn allows 1+ tuples to be fetched)
    - determine where changes need to be made
- [x] import tornado framework datasets

## Experiments
- modify MDDM to use a sliding window of weighted prediction confidence (Bayesian model?)
-  *NOPE* online and chunk-based learning in parallel (using â‰  sized chunks)
- overlapping chunks
    - evaluation
        - each classifier does prequential on its own chunk
        - drift detected if slided window chunks don't predict same class or confidence lowers (depends on window/chunk size)
    - examples
        - chunk 1 [1,2,3] 1' [2,3,4] 1'' [3,4,5] for c1, c2, c3
        - chunk 2 [4,5,6] 2' [5,6,7] 2'' [6,7,8] for c1, c2, c3
        - chunk 3 [7,8,9] 3' [8,9,10] 3'' [9,10,11]
- max velocity of incoming tuples / run time


run a sliding (pov: stream) tumbling (pov: classifier in the ensemble) window

modify window size in real time 2015?

kaggle for social good?


drop only one classifier (or more)!
